    "SAMPLE_OUTPUT": " Hi Grandpa, it's your Alex here, and I hope you still have a special place for me in your heart. I've been keeping busy, you know! I'm still out there playing basketball and soccer in my free time. And guess what? I haven't given up on skiing; in fact, I'm planning a skiing trip for us this winter. I'll never forget the time when I was just 8 years old and won that spelling bee. You were beaming with pride, and your words of encouragement meant the world to me. By the way, I've also introduced my friends to a catchy tune: Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down. They all adore it, just like I do! In case you need a refresher, my lovely mom is Lucy, and my ever-supportive dad is Bob. Of course, there's my sweet sister, Alice. I hope these names ring a bell! Speaking of cherished memories, do you remember that time when I was 10, and I had a little skirmish with Alice? You took me to the beach and taught me how to skip stones. Your wisdom was incredible. You told me to channel all my frustration into those stones, and the more times they skipped, the more anger I released. We kept skipping stones until the sun dipped below the horizon. Grandpa, I hope these moments still shine bright in your memory. They certainly do in mine. I want you to know that I love you deeply."
